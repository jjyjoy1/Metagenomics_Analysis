Optimizing the Pipeline with Optuna: Multi-Phase Strategy
Using Optuna to tune your pipeline parameters is a smart approach, especially given the complexity of this workflow. 

I outline a strategic approach to split the pipeline into logical optimization phases.
Phase-Based Optimization Strategy
Phase 1: Assembly & Binning Optimization
Target Parameters:

MEGAHIT parameters (k-mer sizes, min-count)
MetaBAT2 sensitivity parameters (min-contig, min-score)
GraphBin parameters (weighting factors)

Optimization Metric:

N50 of assembled contigs
Number and completeness of bins (as measured by CheckM)
Percentage of reads mapped back to contigs

Rationale:
Assembly quality directly impacts all downstream analyses. Optimizing this phase first ensures you have the best possible foundation for novelty detection.
Phase 2: Taxonomic Classification Optimization
Target Parameters:

CAT/BAT confidence scores
MMseqs2 sensitivity and e-value thresholds
GTDB-Tk classification parameters
ANI thresholds for novelty

Optimization Metric:

Classification consistency between tools
Proportion of classified vs. unclassified contigs
Recovery of known mock community members (if available)

Rationale:
The accuracy of taxonomic classification directly affects your ability to identify truly novel organisms versus merely unclassifiable sequences.
Phase 3: Viral Detection Optimization
Target Parameters:

VirSorter2 score thresholds
VIBRANT scoring parameters
DeepVirFinder score and p-value thresholds
CheckV quality thresholds

Optimization Metric:

Agreement between viral detection tools
Number of complete or high-quality viral genomes
Recovery of known viral sequences (if spiked in)

Rationale:
Viral detection is notoriously challenging, and parameter tuning can significantly impact sensitivity and specificity.
Phase 4: Embedding & Anomaly Detection Optimization
Target Parameters:

Embedding model selection (ESM2 vs. ProtT5 vs. ESM1b)
Embedding hyperparameters (pooling method, layer selection)
Anomaly detection algorithm selection
Isolation Forest contamination parameter
VAE architecture and training parameters
DBSCAN eps and min_samples parameters

Optimization Metric:

Clustering quality metrics (silhouette score)
Anomaly detection precision/recall on known test cases
Agreement between different anomaly detection methods

Rationale:
The embedding and anomaly detection components represent the most novel part of your pipeline and likely have the most tunable parameters.
Phase 5: Integration Optimization
Target Parameters:

Weighting factors for evidence from different tools
Confidence thresholds for novel pathogen calling
Score combination methods

Optimization Metric:

Accuracy on synthetic benchmark datasets with known novel organisms
False positive rate

Rationale:
How you integrate evidence from multiple tools is critical for your final novel pathogen predictions.
Practical Implementation Approach

Modular Script Design:

Create separate config files for each phase's parameters
Design your scripts to easily accept parameter changes from Optuna

Optimization Isolation:

Run optimization for each phase using the outputs from previous optimized phases
This prevents parameter interactions between phases from creating an unmanageable search space

Benchmark Dataset Creation:

Create synthetic datasets with known novel pathogens for testing
Use public mock communities with known compositions
Consider spike-ins of known pathogens at varying abundances

Compute Resource Considerations:

Focus intensive optimization on smaller datasets
Apply optimized parameters to full datasets
Consider using cloud computing for parallel Optuna trials

Warm-Starting Strategy:

Begin with expert-recommended parameter values rather than totally random search
Use literature values as starting points for optimization

Optuna Implementation Suggestions
For each phase:

Define parameter spaces based on domain knowledge
Create an objective function that runs the relevant part of the pipeline
Use appropriate Optuna samplers (TPE for most cases)
Implement pruning to terminate unpromising trials early

Unique Challenges for Novel Pathogen Detection
Parameter optimization for novelty detection presents a specific challenge: how do you optimize for finding something unknown? Some approaches:

Surrogate Metrics:

Use recovery of deliberately "held-out" reference genomes as a proxy for novelty detection
Measure the ability to identify deliberately modified sequences


Synthetic Benchmarks:

Create chimeric genomes that should appear as novel
Introduce artificial evolutionary divergence to known genomes


Consistency Metrics:

Reward consistent novel predictions across different methods
Penalize inconsistent or contradictory classifications

This phase-based optimization approach allows to manage the complexity of tuning such a diverse pipeline while ensuring that each component is performing optimally before moving to the next. The key is to define meaningful metrics for each phase that correlate with your ultimate goal of novel pathogen detection.
