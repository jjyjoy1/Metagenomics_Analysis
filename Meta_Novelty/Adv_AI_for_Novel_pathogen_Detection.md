# Advanced ML/DL Approaches for Novel Pathogen Detection

## 1. Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) for Novelty Detection

VAEs are well-suited for novel pathogen detection as they learn the underlying distribution of normal data and identify outliers.

### VAE Architecture Design

**Input Layer Options:**
- **Combined Matrix VAE:** Concatenate multiple feature matrices (pan-genome, KO abundance, taxonomic profiles) into a single input.
- **Matrix-Specific VAEs:** Train separate VAEs for each data type, then combine latent spaces.
- **Hierarchical VAE:** Use a hierarchical structure where lower-level VAEs capture specific data types, feeding into a higher-level VAE.

**Encoder Structure:**
- Start with dense layers for high-dimensional inputs.
- Use dropout (0.1-0.3) to prevent overfitting.
- Add batch normalization between layers.
- Decrease dimensions gradually (e.g., from input size → 256 → 128 → 64 → latent dimension).

**Latent Space Considerations:**
- Dimensionality: 16-32 dimensions typically captures enough variance.
- β-VAE modification: Tune β parameter to balance reconstruction vs. KL-divergence.
- Conditional VAE: Incorporate metadata as conditioning variables.

**Decoder Structure:**
- Mirror the encoder (symmetric architecture).
- Final activation depends on data: sigmoid for binary data (pan-genome), softmax for taxonomic data.

### VAE Training Strategy

**Pre-processing:**
- Apply proper normalization for each data type:
  - Center-scale for continuous data.
  - Log-transform for count data.
  - Keep binary data as is.
- Handle sparse matrices efficiently.
- Consider feature selection to reduce dimensionality.

**Training Process:**
- Split data into training/validation sets (80/20).
- Early stopping to prevent overfitting.
- Implement KL annealing (gradually introduce KL loss).
- Use customized loss functions for different data types.
- Consider curriculum learning (start with simpler patterns).

**Hyperparameter Optimization:**
- Key parameters: latent dimension size, learning rate, β value.
- Use Bayesian optimization or grid search.
- Evaluate using reconstruction error and KL divergence.

### Novelty Detection with VAEs

**Anomaly Scoring Methods:**
- Reconstruction Error: Higher for novel pathogens.
- KL Divergence: Measures how far sample is from learned distribution.
- Combined Score: Weighted sum of reconstruction error and KL divergence.
- Mahalanobis Distance in latent space.

**Threshold Determination:**
- Use known outgroups to calibrate.
- Set threshold based on percentiles of training data.
- Implement adaptive thresholding.

**Visualization of Novelty:**
- 2D projection of latent space using t-SNE or UMAP.
- Color-code by anomaly score.
- Interactive visualization with sample metadata.

## 2. Complementary ML/DL Approaches

### Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)

Particularly valuable for capturing relationships between pathogens.

### Transfer Learning from Reference Databases

**Pre-training on Known Pathogens:**
- Train models on NCBI/GTDB references.
