Metagenomics involves sequencing and analyzing genetic material directly from environmental samples, leading to massive, complex datasets that capture the diversity of microbial communities. Traditional bioinformatics methods can struggle with the scale and complexity of these datasets. 

This has paved the way for AI-driven data strategies methods that integrate machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), and other artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to improve data quality, accelerate processing, and uncover hidden patterns or novel biological insights.

Key benefits of AI in metagenomics include:

Automation: Reducing manual curation through automated quality control and feature extraction.
Scalability: Handling large-scale datasets via efficient algorithms.
Pattern Recognition: Uncovering subtle, nonlinear relationships in data that traditional statistics might miss.
Predictive Modeling: Enhancing taxonomic classification, functional annotation, and ecological inference.
Roadmap for AI-Driven Metagenomics Analysis

The process can be broadly divided into several stages, each of which can benefit from AI approaches:

1. Data Acquisition & Preprocessing
