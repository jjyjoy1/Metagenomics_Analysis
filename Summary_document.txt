Enhanced QIIME2 16S rRNA Metagenomics Pipeline Summary:

Pipeline Structure
The pipeline is organized as a Snakemake workflow, which provides efficient, reproducible, and scalable analysis. The workflow uses a manifest file as the initial input containing all sample information.
Key Components:

Quality Control

Implemented DADA2 for denoising paired-end reads with configurable parameters
Added Deblur as an alternative QC method
Includes visualization of QC results for assessment


Reference Databases and Taxonomic Assignment

Automated download of SILVA and Greengenes reference databases
Extraction of V3-V4 specific regions from reference sequences for improved classification
Naive Bayes classifier implementation using scikit-learn
Custom Python script for standalone taxonomic classification


Diversity Analyses

Alpha diversity metrics: Shannon, Simpson, Faith's PD
Beta diversity measures: PCoA, Bray-Curtis, weighted/unweighted UniFrac
Statistical testing for group differences
Phylogenetic tree generation for UniFrac metrics


Differential Abundance Testing

ANCOM implementation for compositional data analysis
DESeq2 integration via R script
LEfSe preparation and execution


Workflow Management and Documentation

Snakemake for efficient workflow management
Comprehensive configuration system
Detailed README and documentation
